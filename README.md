# netflix-dataset-analysis
EDA on netfix shows and movies dataset
I have used the netflix dataset available on kaggle:
Link-> /kaggle/input/netflix-shows
This is a very basic analysis that helped me understand the concepts of grouping and manipulating the data
The analysis can be further enhanced using matplotlib and seaborn.
